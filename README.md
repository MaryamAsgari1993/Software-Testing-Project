# Building the Project with Maven

## This project uses Apache Maven as the build automation tool. To build the project, follow these steps:

    1. Make sure you have Maven installed on your system.
    2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
    3. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project.
    4. Run the following command:
    mvn clean install

This will download all the required dependencies and build the project. The generated JAR file will be placed in the target directory.

    Note: You can also import the project into an IDE of your choice and build it using the IDE's built-in Maven support.
